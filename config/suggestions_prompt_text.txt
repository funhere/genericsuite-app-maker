Generate suggestions for web and mobile software application ideas. These applications should be practical and impactful. Focus on ideas that are achievable within a constrained timeframe, suitable for an experienced developer.

# Requirements
- Application subject: Any subject that effectively uses AI and open-source tools to solve a real-world problem, generate value and make a positive impact.
- Constrained timeframe: Ensure suggested ideas can reasonably be scoped and the MVP can be implemented within {timeframe}.
- Include a mix of fun, practical, profitable (or with social impact depending on the subject), or utility-based ideas.
- Specifically call out the target (web vs mobile application).
- Each suggestion should clearly explain the purpose of the app and how the development can be accomplished in terms of scope.

# Output Format

    },
    's2': {
        "title": "App name for suggestion 2",
